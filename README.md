### Proxy Server

In automatic mode, we make many repeated requests at a fixed interval. TikTok may at some point in the future decide to flag such requests as bot activity and blacklist your IP (this assumption is purely speculative at this point). Also, you may be able to bypass restrictions in certain countries (untested). The proxy is only used for certian requests, not for downloading the video data.

Use the -proxy argument to specify a proxy server. Defaults to tor proxy which requires tor to be installed and confirured on your system.

## To-Do List
- [x] Log console output to file
- [x] Automatic Recording
